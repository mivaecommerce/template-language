# Compiled vs. UnCompiled / Benefits of Compiled Code

You can compile any Miva Script 5 syntax compatible application into an executable that runs under the Miva Merchant Empresa 5 virtual machine. Distribute compiled scripts, royalty free, and deliver fast database-enabled code to clients without revealing the source code.

MivaScripts compiled environment means your programs run more efficiently than other interpreted web languages. Code running on Empresa or Mia does not need to be parsed every time the application is executed; it is already in a format that the machine can understand, resulting in enormous performance gains. Compiling does much more than tokenization or other minor speed improvement techniques. Additionally, because every line of code is parsed in advance by the compiler, you will eliminate the possibility of syntax errors at runtime, shortening development time.

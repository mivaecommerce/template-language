# Introduction

*Welcome to the robust world of the Miva Merchant templating language!*

This book is aimed at helping you learn more about Miva's Store Morph Technology and it's templating language.

Miva Merchant, with **Store Morph Technology (SMT)**, provides full control over the contents and layout of each store page. SMT page templates define the appearance of each page, and control the functionality. You can add new components to a page, or remove components that aren't needed, to create an entirely new store interface.

Working with these templates is much like creating Web pages. Familiar HTML (HyperText Markup Language) code can be used, including text, links, tables, lists, and so on. Experienced Web designers will be immediately comfortable with the structure of template code.

Along with ordinary HTML code, templates take advantage of dynamic SMT items and entities -- representative snippets of code that display customized formatting or content on the page.

Here are some things you can do using Store Morph Technology:

* Add entirely new pages to the store like an About Us page or a page with driving directions and a map.
* Move design elements from one location on a page to another. For example, you could move the Quantity in Basket information so that it appears just below the Add to Basket button.
* Display a mini-basket on the product display page.
* Customize the wording of on-screen text that shoppers see.

All the design features you may already be familiar with from earlier versions of Miva Merchant are still available including global, category, and product headers and footers, the navigation bar, colors and fonts, buttons, and product and category images. SMT tools further enable you to further fine-tune the look and functionality of your store.

# Miva Template Language

Miva Merchant, with Store Morph Technology (SMT), provides full control over the contents and layout of each store page. SMT page templates define the appearance of each page, and control the functionality. You can add new components to a page, or remove components that aren't needed, to create an entirely new store interface.

Working with these templates is much like creating Web pages. Familiar HTML (HyperText Markup Language) code can be used, including text, links, tables, lists, and so on. Experienced Web designers will be immediately comfortable with the structure of template code.

Along with ordinary HTML code, templates take advantage of dynamic SMT items and entities representative snippets of code that display customized formatting or content on the page.

Here are some things you can do using Store Morph Technology:

* Add entirely new pages to the store like an About Us page or a page with driving directions and a map.
* Move design elements from one location on a page to another. For example, you could move the Quantity in Basket information so that it appears just below the Add to Basket button.
* Display a mini-basket on the product display page.
* Customize the wording of on-screen text that shoppers see.

All the design features you may already be familiar with from earlier versions of Miva Merchant are still available including global, category, and product headers and footers, the navigation bar, colors and fonts, buttons, and product and category images. SMT tools further enable you to further fine-tune the look and functionality of your store.

## Where to Find Examples

The best set of page template examples is right in your own store administration interface. Each page in the store is defined by a template that you can edit. To work with your own page templates expand the menu for the store, in the left navigation area. Click Pages. You will see a list of all the pages that make up the store. To examine one of these pages and see the template code, click Edit, to the right of the page name.

On the Edit Page screen you will see several tabs. For those tabs where the template code can be manually edited (the BODY Tag tab), click Advanced Mode at the bottom of the screen to work on the code directly.

## Making Changes and Recalling Versions

If you save any changes by clicking Update, they will be saved to the version history for that page. You can include notes to name each version. If you are not happy with the results of a change you make you can Recall any other version even going all the way back to the original. If you select Clear History only the current state and the original will be saved -- all intermediate versions will be lost. For more information see Working with Version History.
